# TimeSeriesPrediction
Time series prediction on Road Dataset where length of road is nearly 25Kms and is divided into 100 sections.

## Aim -
To perform predictions of 10th year and parameter 9-13 of every section from the given dataset.

## Methodology -
Transformed the Data into Train and Test Dataset, by extracting 10th year data for para 9-13 for every section.
Applied Extra Regressor Model to implent random forest and predicted the values
